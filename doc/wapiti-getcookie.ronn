=================================================================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`wapiti-getcookie` -u <URL> -c <COOKIE> [options]

## DESCRIPTION

wapiti-getcookie is a user-friendly interactive console utility that can be used to fill a web-form or fetch a URL 
and extract the cookies sent by the remote server.  
Cookie information are stored in the JSON cookie file you have to specify with the -c option.  
Those cookies can be loaded by Wapiti using the same -c option.
   
## OPTIONS

  * `-p`, `--proxy` <PROXY_URL>  
    The given URL will be used as a proxy for HTTP and HTTPS requests.  
    This URL can have one of the following scheme : http, https, socks.  
    To make Wapiti use a Tor listener you can use --proxy socks://127.0.0.1:9050/

  * `--tor`  
    Make Wapiti use a Tor listener (same as --proxy socks://127.0.0.1:9050/)

  * `-a`, `--auth-cred` <CREDENTIALS>  
    Set credentials to use for HTTP authentication on the target.  
    Given value should be in the form login%password (% is used as a separator)
    
  * `--auth-method` <TYPE>
    Set the authentication mechanism to use. Valid choices are basic, digest and ntlm.  
    NTLM authentication may require you to install an additional Python module.

  * `-H`, `--header` <HEADER>  
    Set a custom HTTM header to inject in every request sent by Wapiti.
    This option can be used several times.  
    Value should be a standard HTTP header line (parameter and value separated with a : sign).
    
  * `-A`, `--user-agent` <AGENT>  
    Default behavior of Wapiti is to use the same User-Agent as the TorBrowser, making it discreet when crawling standard website or .onion ones.  
    But you may have to change it to bypass some restrictions so this option is here.
    
  * `-d`, `--data` <DATA>  
    wapiti-getcookie will parse forms and ask your input for each field found.  
    But you can also pass every parameter and value as a string directly through this option.  
    Example: -d 'login=admin&password=letmein&submit=Login'
