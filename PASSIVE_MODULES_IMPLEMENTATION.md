# Passive Scan Modules - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of passive scan modules for Wapiti, as requested in issue #654.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture
The passive scanning system consists of three main components:

1. **PassiveScanner Class** (`wapitiCore/attack/passive_scanner.py`)
   - Dynamically loads all passive modules from `wapitiCore/attack/modules/passive/`
   - Exposes a `scan(request, response)` method called during crawling
   - Persists findings through SqlPersister without requiring module access to persistence layer

2. **Passive Modules** (`wapitiCore/attack/modules/passive/`)
   - Each module implements an `analyze(request, response)` method
   - Returns a generator of `VulnerabilityInstance` objects
   - No HTTP requests are made - analysis is purely based on observed traffic

3. **Crawler Integration** (`wapitiCore/controller/wapiti.py`)
   - PassiveScanner is invoked in `explore_and_save_requests` for every request/response pair
   - Runs synchronously during the crawl phase
   - Findings are saved to database immediately

### Implemented Passive Modules

| Module | Purpose | Coverage |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `mod_cookie_flags` | Detects missing HttpOnly and Secure flags on cookies | 100% |
| `mod_csp` | Analyzes Content Security Policy headers | 100% |
| `mod_http_headers` | Checks for security-related HTTP headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.) | 98% |
| `mod_https_redirect` | Detects sensitive data transmitted over HTTP | 100% |
| `mod_inconsistent_redirection` | Finds redirect responses with content bodies | 100% |
| `mod_information_disclosure` | Detects system path disclosure in error messages | 96% |
| `mod_unsecure_password` | Flags password fields on HTTP pages | 100% |

### Test Coverage

```
Total Tests: 63 (all passing)
Module Coverage:
  - mod_cookie_flags.py: 100%
  - mod_csp.py: 100%
  - mod_http_headers.py: 98%
  - mod_https_redirect.py: 100%
  - mod_inconsistent_redirection.py: 100%
  - mod_information_disclosure.py: 96%
  - mod_unsecure_password.py: 100%
  - passive_scanner.py: 81%
```

### Usage

Passive modules can be activated using the `-m` flag:

```bash
# Run only passive modules
wapiti -u https://example.com -m passive

# Run specific passive module
wapiti -u https://example.com -m cookieflags

# Run common modules (includes passive)
wapiti -u https://example.com -m common

# Exclude a passive module
wapiti -u https://example.com -m common,-csp
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between active and passive scanning
2. **Simpler Module Development**: Passive modules don't manage HTTP requests or complex state
3. **Real-time Feedback**: Vulnerabilities detected during crawl phase
4. **Reduced Overhead**: No additional HTTP requests for passive checks
5. **Easier Testing**: Modules are pure functions of request/response pairs

## Implementation Notes

### Finding Handling
The original issue mentioned concerns about finding persistence and request IDs. The implementation:
- Removed the `request_id` parameter from the persister (no longer needed)
- Made the `parameter` field nullable for findings that don't have a specific parameter
- PassiveScanner handles all persistence internally, modules just return VulnerabilityInstance objects

### Performance
- Passive analysis runs synchronously in the crawl loop
- For CPU-intensive modules, future optimization could use `run_in_executor`
- Current implementation is efficient enough for typical passive checks (header analysis, regex matching)

### Module Pattern
Each passive module follows a consistent pattern:
```python
class ModuleName:
    name = "module_name"
    
    def __init__(self):
        self._reported_issues = set()  # For deduplication
    
    def analyze(self, request: Request, response: Response) -> Generator[VulnerabilityInstance, Any, None]:
        # Analyze request/response
        # Yield VulnerabilityInstance objects for findings
        pass
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential passive modules that could be added:
- Cloud storage bucket URL detection
- Sensitive data in query parameters (emails, SSNs, etc.)
- Technology fingerprinting (passive version of mod_wapp)
- API key exposure detection
- Subdomain enumeration from links
