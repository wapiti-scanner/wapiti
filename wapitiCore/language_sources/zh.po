msgid "Cross Site Scripting"
msgstr "跨站脚本"

msgid "XSS"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability "
"typically found in web applications which allow code injection by malicious "
"web users into the web pages viewed by other users."
msgstr ""

msgid "Examples of such code include HTML code and client-side scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The best way to protect a web application from XSS attacks is ensure that "
"the application performs validation of all headers, cookies, query strings, "
"form fields, and hidden fields."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Encoding user supplied output in the server side can also defeat XSS "
"vulnerabilities by preventing inserted scripts from being transmitted to "
"users in an executable form."

msgid "XXE"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An XML External Entity attack is a type of attack against an application "
"that parses XML input."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external "
"entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of "
"service, server side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective of "
"the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The safest way to prevent XXE is always to disable DTDs (External Entities) "
"completely."
