Wapiti is a web vulnerability scanner written in Python.

http://wapiti-scanner.github.io/

Requirements
============
In order to work correctly, Wapiti needs Python 3.10 or 3.11

All Python module dependencies will be installed automatically if you use the setup.py script or `pip install wapiti3`

See `INSTALL.md <https://github.com/wapiti-scanner/wapiti/blob/master/INSTALL.md>`__ for more details on installation.

Running Wapiti on Windows can be accomplished through the use of `WSL <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux/>`__.

How it works
============

Wapiti works as a "black-box" vulnerability scanner,  that means it won't
study the source code of web applications but will work like a  fuzzer,
scanning the pages of the deployed web application, extracting links and
forms  and attacking  the scripts, sending payloads and looking for error
messages, special strings or abnormal behaviors.


General features
================

+ Generates vulnerability reports in various formats (HTML, XML, JSON, TXT, CSV).
+ Can suspend and resume a scan or an attack (session mechanism using sqlite3 databases).
+ Can give you colors in the terminal to highlight vulnerabilities.
+ Different levels of verbosity.
+ Fast and easy way to activate/deactivate attack modules.
+ Adding a payload can be as easy as adding a line to a text file.
+ Configurable number of concurrent tasks to perform HTTP requests.


Browsing features
=================

+ Support HTTP, HTTPS and SOCKS5 proxies.
+ HTTP authentication on the target (Basic, Digest, NTLM)
+ Authentication by filling login forms.
+ Ability to restrain the scope of the scan (domain, folder, page, url).
+ Automatic removal of one or more parameters in URLs.
+ Multiple safeguards against scan endless-loops (for example, limit of values for a parameter).
+ Possibility to set the first URLs to explore (even if not in scope).
+ Can exclude some URLs of the scan and attacks (eg: logout URL).
+ Import cookies from your Chrome or Firefox browser or using the `wapiti-getcookie` tool.
+ Can activate / deactivate SSL certificates verification.
+ Extract URLs from Flash SWF files.
+ Try to extract URLs from javascript (very basic JS interpreter).
+ HTML5 aware (understand recent HTML tags).
+ Several options to control the crawler behavior and limits.
+ Skipping some parameter names during attack.
+ Setting a maximum time for the scan process.
+ Adding some custom HTTP headers or setting a custom User-Agent.
+ Using a Firefox headless browser for crawling
+ Loading your own python code for complicated authentication cases (see `--form-script` option)
+ Adding custom URL or PATH to update Wappalyzer database
+ Scan REST APIs given an OpenAPI (swagger) file


Supported attacks
=================

+ SQL Injections (Error based, boolean based, time based) and XPath Injections
+ LDAP injections (Error based and boolean based)
+ Cross Site Scripting (XSS) reflected and permanent
+ File disclosure detection (local and remote include, require, fopen, readfile...)
+ Command Execution detection (eval(), system(), passtru()...)
+ XXE (Xml eXternal Entity) injection
+ CRLF Injection
+ Search for potentially dangerous files on the server (thank to the Nikto db)
+ Bypass of weak htaccess configurations
+ Search for copies (backup) of scripts on the server
+ Shellshock
+ Folder and file enumeration (DirBuster like)
+ Server Side Request Forgery (through use of an external Wapiti website)
+ Open Redirects
+ Detection of uncommon HTTP methods (like PUT)
+ Basic CSP Evaluator 
+ Brute Force login form (using a dictionary list)
+ Checking HTTP security headers
+ Checking cookie security flags (secure and httponly flags)
+ Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) basic detection
+ Fingerprinting of web applications using the Wappalyzer database, gives related CVE information
+ Enumeration of CMS modules for Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, SPIP, etc
+ Subdomain takeovers detection
+ Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) detection
+ Spring4Shell (CVE-2020-5398) detection
+ Check https redirections
+ Check for file upload vulnerabilities
+ Detection of network devices
+ Inject payloads inside JSON body too

Wapiti supports both GET and POST HTTP methods for attacks.  
It also supports multipart and can inject payloads in filenames (upload).  
Display a warning when an anomaly is found (for example 500 errors and timeouts)  
Makes the difference between permanent and reflected  XSS vulnerabilities.

Module names
============

The aforementioned attacks are tied to the following module names :

+ backup (Search copies of scripts and archives on the web server)
+ brute_login_form (Brute Force login form using a dictionary list)
+ buster (DirBuster like module)
+ cms (Scan to detect CMS and their versions)
+ cookieflags (Checks Secure and HttpOnly flags)
+ crlf (CR-LF injection in HTTP headers)
+ csp (Detect lack of CSP or weak CSP configuration)
+ csrf (Detects forms not protected against CSRF or using weak anti-CSRF tokens)
+ exec (Code execution or command injection)
+ file (Path traversal, file inclusion, etc)
+ htaccess (Misconfigured htaccess restrictions)
+ htp (Identify web technologies used the HashThePlanet database)
+ http_header (Check HTTP security headers)
+ https_redirect (Check https redirections)
+ ldap (Error-based and boolean-based LDAP injection detection)
+ log4shell (Detects websites vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228)
+ methods (Look for uncommon available HTTP methods like PUT)
+ network_device (Look for common files to detect network devices)
+ nikto (Look for known vulnerabilities by testing URL existence and checking responses)
+ permanentxss (Rescan the whole target after the xss module execution looking for previously tainted payloads)
+ redirect (Open Redirects)
+ shellshock (Test Shellshock attack, see `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_%28software_bug%29>`__)
+ spring4shell (Detects websites vulnerable to CVE-2020-5398)
+ sql (Error-based and boolean-based SQL injection detection)
+ ssl (Evaluate the security of SSL/TLS certificate configuration, requires `sslscan <https://github.com/rbsec/sslscan>`__)
+ ssrf (Server Side Request Forgery)
+ takeover (Subdomain takeover)
+ timesql (SQL injection vulnerabilities detected with time-based methodology)
+ upload (File upload vulnerabilities)
+ wapp (Not an attack module, retrieves web technologies with versions and categories in use on the target, find corresponding CVEs)
+ wp_enum (Enumerate plugins and themes on a Wordpress website)
+ xss (XSS injection module)
+ xxe (XML External Entity attack)

Module names can be given as comma separated list using the "-m" or "--module" option.


How to get the best results
===========================

To find more vulnerabilities (as some attacks are error-based), you can modify
your webserver configurations.

For example, you can set the following values in your PHP configuration :

.. code-block::

    safe_mode = Off
    display_errors = On (recommended)
    magic_quotes_gpc = Off
    allow_url_fopen = On
    mysql.trace_mode = On


Where to get help
=================

In the prompt, just type the following command to get the basic usage :

    wapiti -h

You can also take a look at the manpage (wapiti.1 or wapiti.1.html) for more details on each option.

We also have an official wiki which is more exhaustive : https://github.com/wapiti-scanner/wapiti/wiki
